# Arduino_APS_UNIP_2019
Arduino's source code

This arduino code was used for a college activity and used to check the data of DHT22 sensor (measures temperature and humidity) and a rain sensor (check if the metal plate is wet). All of them output a numeric info, but the rain part, depending of how high the value is, it is converted to a string. 

After the sensor reading, the code output the data in this order: temperature, humidity and isRaining.
